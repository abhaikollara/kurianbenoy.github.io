In this paper we discuss about neural network-based system for Text to Speech(TTS) synthesis that can generate speech
audio in the voice of different speakers, including those unseen during training. This research paper was presented
during 32nd conference of NeurIPS 2018, Montreal, Canada and is authored by researchers from Google Inc.
