## Contributing to OpenSource With CloudCV

So here I am going to describe about experience contributing CloudCV organisation. I started to know about this organisation because of my friend Adarsh S who is a perivious GSoC winner, with CloudCV.
CloudCV has mainly three Projects ie:
1) EvalAI - a Open source platform for Machine Learning Competitions like Kaggle
2) Origami - A services to make your Machine learning models deployable anywhere in WEb
3) Fabrik - A model making software

I started contributing to Origami initially from January. I started solving some issues initially. But the organisation mentors were not so active
So some basic PR's I put in Origami didn't get merged as they were not active. I became also active in forums. Being Discouraged by lack of inactivity, I pinged sometime in January end, Cloud CV org Administrator.
RishabJain told to me on pinging him that Origami won't be participating this time. Instead of that he told me to start contributing on EvalAI instead.
