Must read book. I read this book twice so far


## The C Programming Language - Brian W Kernghan, Denis M Ritchi

An excellent introduction to C, datastructures by this excellent book. I read this book for a quick revision and this
books talks in depth datastructures, some algorithms, pointers, structures, Input and Outpur and UNIX system interfaces.
Things like Shell sort, itoa, atoai and implements things from scratch as mentioned in this book is a good exercise.
Reading this book made me to rant all first years need to do is Read this book and no hackathons/websites/ML etc.

## Confessions - Leo Tolstoy

Leo Tolstoy is a famous author with many famous books like Anna Karina, War and Peace, etc. I haven't read none of his
works so far, I am hoping to read these in the near future soon. Confessions shows moral dilemma Tolstoy faced, he asked
familar question `What is the point of life?` in this book. He finds these answers finally by understanding there is a
god exsisting, that too from the peasants. He is highly critical of Russian orthodox church, but he finds the true
christanity in this book.
