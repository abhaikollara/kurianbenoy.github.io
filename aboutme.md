Hi, I am Kurian Benoy. I am currently a bachelors student at Govt. Model Engineering College. I am interested in
computer science and an open source contributor. I was a FOSS OpenTechNights Winner and have attend International
FOSSASIA SUmmit, Singapore, 2019. 


### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
